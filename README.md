# Zombone
The world has officially ended, after the outbreak of an unknown virus that caused dead people to come back alive almost the entirety of humanity has been wiped out. You are one of the few people ‘lucky’ enough to make it this far, by utilising your survival skills and proficiency with various weapons. It is up to you to fight and kill all the dead people so they can all finally rest. 
## Mechanics
### Gameplay loop
This will be very similar to COD zombie mode, where there will be waves of zombies coming to kill you that exponentially get stronger and more frequent. There are weapons scattered throughout the map and zombies sometimes drop ammo or health kits. The longer you survive the higher your score will be. 
## Player
This is an FPS shooter, you move around with WASD and jump with spacebar. You aim and shoot with the mouse buttons and scroll through your weapons with the scroll wheel. Health will be like Call of Duty where your HP loss isn’t permanent but fades away either after some time passes or you heal. 
## Weapons
You start off with basic weapons and can find new ones scattered throughout the map. You will always have a very basic pistol with infinite ammo. Different weapons have different fire rates and damage numbers. 
Zombies
These are the main enemies of the game, they come in various different forms and will run towards the player when seen. They take increased damage when hit in the head.
